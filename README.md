# DeepSupp - Stock Support Level Prediction

This project implements and compares various methods for predicting stock price support levels, including a novel deep learning approach called "DeepSupp".

## Project Structure

- `dataset/` - Contains historical price data
- `predictions/` - Contains support level predictions from different methods
- `src/` - Source code for the project
- `figures/` - Generated visualizations

## Methods Implemented

1. **DeepSupp** - Our novel deep learning approach
2. **HMM** - Hidden Markov Model based prediction
3. **Local Minima** - Support levels based on local price minima
4. **Fractal** - Fractal-based support levels
5. **Moving Average** - Support levels based on moving averages
6. **Fibonacci** - Fibonacci retracement levels
