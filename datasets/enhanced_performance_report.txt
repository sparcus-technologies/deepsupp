Six fundamental financial metrics used as ground truth:
1. Support Accuracy: How often prices bounce off predicted support levels
2. Price Proximity: How close support levels are to actual price percentiles
3. Volume Confirmation: Whether high volume accompanies support bounces
4. Market Regime Sensitivity: Performance across bull/bear/sideways markets
5. Support Hold Duration: How long support levels remain valid
6. False Breakout Rate: Recovery rate after brief support breaks
